# CeeJsRadx3's Windows Setup

![windows preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ceejsradx3/dotfiles/master/preview.png)

This repo is a workflow to automate the configuration my Windows installations. This is primarily tailored to my machine that is used for my line of work as a System Administrator. Feel free to explore, copy and re-use the code as you see fit.

## Installation

**Warning**: I recommend you fork and review the code first, before giving these scripts
a try. Make sure to set the execution policy by running `Set-ExecutionPolicy Remotesigned` first.

Ideally you should be cloning the repo into your home directory as that's where my scripts will being referring to :

    git clone http://github.com/ceejsradx3/commandcenter.git && cd commandcenter && ./install.sh

That's about it, I think... I'm sure as time passes, and I learn more things, this repo will evolve.
